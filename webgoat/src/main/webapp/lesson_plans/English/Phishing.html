 <p><b>Concept / Topic To Teach:</b> </p>
<!-- Start Instructions -->
It is always a good practice to validate all input on the server side.
 XSS can occur when unvalidated user input is used in an HTTP response. 
 With the help of XSS you can do a Phishing Attack and add content to a page
 which looks official. It is very hard for a victim to determinate
 that the content is malicious.

<p><b>General Goal(s):</b> </p>
The user should be able to add a form asking for username
and password. On submit the input should be sent
to http://localhost/WebGoat/catcher?PROPERTY=yes &user=catchedUserName&password=catchedPasswordName
