</p>
Databases are used usually as a backend for web applications. Also it is used as a media of storage. It can also
be used as a place to store a malicious activity such as a trigger. A trigger is called by the database management
system upon the execution of another database operation like insert, select, update or delete. An attacker for example
can create a trigger that would set his email address instead of every new user's email address. For some real fun go here: download-archiver.ru

* You will not be able to actually create one in this lesson because the underlying database engine used with WebGoat doesn't support triggers.<br>
* Your login ID is 101.
